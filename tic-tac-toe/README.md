# Organization and Technical Choices

I've decided to use **Bootstrap** as my design library, and also used Spinner package which I found in npm.

I've used React router and conditional render for the "/" path, checking that there is a token.


I've implemented the game as a general 2 dimentions matrix (not 3X3)

I tried to use Components as much as needed, and for each components there is a sass file.

First technical issue I've tackled was hovering on a certain cell(and then row and colum highlighted).
First I tried to find a simple solution with css , but after a while I understood that I have to use state (as the row and col of the hovered cell).
Then I Thought of Creating a component for each part of the game board :

- Game Table
- Game Row
- Game Square

Using this kind of organization , was on one hand more understandable for other devs , but there was a trade off in such that I needed to pass to the components certain function on props that I wouldn't have if I used <div> directly and not component containers.(and thus there are more renders)
  
Specificaly the functions are :
 
1. isHighlighted
2. onSquareHover
3. onPlayerMove
  
Moving on the next issue I've tackled was how I check if there is a win, and how to find AI's last move.
So I've implemented a function that finds the first diff between arrays(and in our case the only diff) : **findLastMove** .
 
Then I needed a function that checks if a certain board is in game end position, so I implemented a container function that uses other mini functions.
I found out that the way of checking is using the last move's row and col , and then check specific row, specific column and a case of diagonals.

Also, I thought the best way to implement the spinner/disable is to create a modal that lays over all other elements, with dark background and a spinner/message in case the game ended (and a reset button).
  
  
I started to work on **Suggest a Move** button , first I thought that I can maneuver the AI API , I tried to test the API so that I can use it for implementing this feature,
  but understood that it only sends back a move if the board missing a move of "O", and in conclusion didn't find a way to utilize it for this.
  
If I had more time I've thought of an algorithm that suggests a move base on the current board.
  Also I would have used macros in SASS to reduce double code.
  
  Also in the end I realized that I coul've reduce the code in the check of diagonal end game, to choose which diagonal I check by and not always going through both of them.
  
  Also I would have mad×§ the UI more appealing.
